            <h3>Future Uses</h3>
            <p>
                Although Artificial Intelligence already has many uses in jobs, its future impact will be even more 
                substantial. In the near future, AI will most likely take over a lot more jobs, as well as make a lot 
                more jobs easier. <br><br>
                In fact, AI taking over jobs has actually been a serious threat, and many people are worried that in the 
                near future, there will not be anough jobs for people due to AI. Things have already gone into play to prevent
                this, but it is still a big threat.
