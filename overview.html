            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool that can perform human tasks robotically. Most of the time,
                it is used to answer questions, or generate pictures that do not exist in the real world. AI can also be
                trained to play video games, or generate videos (to a certain extent) off of a single prompt.

                AI is alreay making many jobs easier, and is even starting to completely automate some jobs.

                An important part of AI is machine learning. Mahcine learning is when an AI is programmed to learn how to
                play a certain game. This game could be a video game or board game. Usually, after days, weeks, or even months
                of trial and error, the AI will become so good at the game that no human can beat it. This just goes to show how
                powerful AI is.
